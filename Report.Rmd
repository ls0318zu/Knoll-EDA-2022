# Predicting Human wolf Conflict in Minnesota

## Abstract

In Minnesota, the wolf population has been on the rise for the last few decades. More recently, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' Division of Fish and Wildlife (DNR) has raised questions regarding the overall wolf population, management and behaviors. Additionally, further questions came to surface when cattle and human populations were included. The purpose was to analyze wolf behaviors when they are presented with potential conflicts. For this research, data was collected from the DNR, Minnesota State Demographic Center and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. By analyzing the data, we were able to reach predictions of potential predation by wolves. After comparing the densities of the populations by districts and counties, conclusions were able  to be reached. In the state maps provided, the counties with the lighter blue are areas where there is a higher risk of predation and conflict between the stated groups. 

## Introduction

In the 1960's, the wolf population in Minnesota was only around 400 wolves. Within the past 40 years, thanks to wildlife biologists, the population has soared to an estimated 2,400 in 2020. Making sure populations are stable is a major way to help ecosystems thrive in the wild. However, what happens when humans are part of that ecosystem. Human-wildlife conflict is when encounters between humans and wildlife end in negative results, such as loss of property, livelihoods, or even life. With the rise in population of wolves in the past couple of decades  there has also been a rise in trapping and killing of  the animals to keep people and livestock safe.(Mech D.) What if we could predict where conflict take place in Minnesota between humans and wolves? That is what is done in this exploratory data analysis. By looking at wolf population, human population, and cattle population we hope to find some pattern as to where we should see human wolf conflict in Minnesota.​

## Methods

The wolf population data was obtained from the Minnesota Wolf Population update 2020, documented by the Minnesota DNR. The cattle population data was obtained from a survey recorded by the USDA, and the human population data was taken from Minnesota State Demographic Center's website. Once the data was organized on excel spreadsheets the data was uploaded, combined, and reorganized using RStudio. Continuing the use of RStudio several graphs were created to display the data in order to find correlation. First, scatter plots were made showing wolf to human population, and wolf to cattle population. The second batch came in the form of maps showing density of our data. Using the 'ubrmrp' program, we calculated wolf population/miles squared, human population/miles squared, and cattle population/miles squared to get the densities per county for each data set. Once these were calculated, we created maps showing the ratio of densities compared over each other.​

## Results

Looking at Figure 2, which shows the wolf population vs the human population in each county. This data showed no correlation between the two populations. Our line of best fit gave no real indication as to which way our data sways. When we created a scatter-plot of the wolf population to cattle population it yielded the same results. The scatter-plot showed no true correlation with our numbers being all over the board.​

Looking at the densities of each data point and mapping, those numbers yielded some possible answers. In figure 2, we took the wolf density over the human density and mapped it out. It is shown that in the lighter blue areas in the northern part of the state is where we would expect to see human wolf conflict. In the middle and southern part of the state, that is shown in dark blue, there is a lower chance of seeing human wolf conflict. In figure 3, we mapped out the wolf density to the cattle density and found that there could be a chance of conflict in the northeastern part of the state in Cook and Lake counties. With the rest of the state having virtually no chance for conflict. They gray areas show where we had no data for cattle or wolves.​

## Discussion

The results of this exploratory data analysis are very interesting. Within figure 2 we would expect to see more human wolf conflict in the northern counties, or the lighter blue hues of the ratio scale, because the density ratio of wolves to humans is higher than in the southern portion of Minnesota. The further south you go the human population increases, and the wolf population decreases. Also, the wolf's territory range only goes as far south as Chicago county. That is why the southernmost portion of  the map displays zero display of ratio densities.  With the wolf and cattle map, we see the light blue area where we expect to see conflict are only in Cook and Lake counties.​

Most of the livestock in Minnesota are in the southern part of the state, and since wolves are in the northern part this explains why there is only predicted conflict in the northeastern tip. It is the only area where the two populations meet. The significance of this exploratory data analysis is that these data sets have never been brought together before. Residents' attitudes on wolves are a little controversial depending on if you are a hunter, livestock owner, or just a resident(Schroeder). However, they do agree on a few things, wolves are a danger to pets, livestock, and the white-tailed deer population.  According to the DNR in 2019, wolves killed 74 calves, 11 cows, 2 sheep, and 2 dogs. From 2014 to 2018 the Minnesota Department of Agriculture made annual depredation payment of $150,000 to livestock producers. Residents also agree that maintaining wolves' numbers and range in Minnesota is important(Schroeder).​

By comparing the data sets and calculating the densities of cattle, wolf, and human populations within the state of Minnesota, we were able to locate the areas of higher risk of predation and conflict. Between wolves and cattle, the county with the highest risk is Saint Louis, which is located near the North shore. Wolf and human conflict is highest in the northern counties of Minnesota– especially Lake of the Woods. This information could be used in several ways to better help safety between humans and wolves while keeping the population at a manageable level.​
